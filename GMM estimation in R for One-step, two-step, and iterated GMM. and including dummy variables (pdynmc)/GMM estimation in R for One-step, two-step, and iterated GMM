In this Tuto we will learn to estimat a model with GMM.
"pdynmc" is an R-package for GMM estimation of linear dynamic panel data models that are based on nonlinear moment conditions as proposed by Ahn and Schmidt(1995). 
In addition, we allow for iterated GMM in light of recent developments in its theory.
In this video we will see the following Points:
