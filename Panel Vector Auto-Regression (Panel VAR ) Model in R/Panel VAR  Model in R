This package (panelvar) extend two general methods of moment (GMM) estimators to panel vector autoregression models 
(PVAR) with p lags of endogenous variables, predetermined and strictly exogenous variables. We ﬁrst extend the ﬁrst difference 
GMM estimator to this extended PVAR model. Second, we do the same for the system GMM estimator.
We implement these estimators in the R package panelvar. In addition to the GMM estimators, we contribute to the empirical literature 
by implementing common speciﬁcation tests (Hansen overidentiﬁcation test, lag selection criterion and stability test of the PVAR polynomial) 
and classical structural analysis for PVAR models such as orthogonal and generalized impulse response functions, bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals for impulse response
analysis and forecast error variance decompositions. Finally, we implement the ﬁrst difference and the forward orthogonal transformation to remove the ﬁxed effects.
