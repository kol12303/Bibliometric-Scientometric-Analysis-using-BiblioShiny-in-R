In this Tuto we will learn how to do Simple Linear Regression Using Package in R Called Rattle. 
In our example we chose only two variables to estimate Simple Linear Regression.

In statistics and Econometrics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship 
between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). 
The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; 
for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.
