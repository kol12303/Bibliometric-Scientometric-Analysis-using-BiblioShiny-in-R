In this Tuto we learn How to decompose Gini Coefficient into within effect ant between effect Using R.
The decomposition of the Gini coefficient by between effect  and within effect group or regional inequality (Spatial inequality). 
In most cases there is an overlap or Residual (effect, Term ) of the distribution of both groups. Consequence is that between and 
within group inequality doesn't add up to the total Gini coefficient. 
In those cases there is an overlap term. Also referred to as interaction effect.
