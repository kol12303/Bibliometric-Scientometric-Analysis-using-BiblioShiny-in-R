In This Tuto we will learn how to calculate Theil index using R.
The Theil index is a statistic primarily used to measure economic inequality and other economic phenomena, 
The data that i'm using in this video are artificial.
The Theil index can be easily decomposed in two components: one is the disparities within subgroups 
of regions â€“ where for example is subgroup is identified by a set of regions belonging to a country; 
another one is the disparities between subgroups of regions (i.e. between countries or regions). 
The sum of these two components is equal to the Theil index.
